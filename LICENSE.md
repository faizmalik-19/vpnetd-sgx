## 4. Prohibited Uses

Licensee shall not, directly or indirectly, and shall not permit, assist, or enable any third party to:

**4.1** Deploy, install, use, or execute the software in any production environment, any deployment in a production environment is strictly prohibited.

**5.1** Licensee shall treat the Source Code, all related information, documentation, materials, notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations, and any derivatives or modifications thereof (collectively, "Confidential Information") and protect it with at least the same degree of care used for its own most sensitive confidential information, but in no event less than the highest level of care and security using industry-standard administrative, physical, and technical safeguards. Licensee shall immediately, but in no event later than 24 hours after discovery, notify Licensor in writing of any actual or suspected unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of the Source Code, and shall cooperate fully with Licensor's investigation and remediation efforts.

**5.2** Source Code access shall occur only in a secure review environment designated and controlled by Licensor, with no copying, screenshots, external storage, photography, or any other form of reproduction or recording allowed. Licensee shall not attempt to circumvent any technical or physical access controls implemented by Licensor.

**6.3** Testing shall occur only in simulated, non-production environments, approved by the Licensor in writing.

## 7. Contributions

Any contributions, suggestions, or Derivative Works shared with Licensor are automatically assigned to Licensor, and Licensee hereby irrevocably assigns all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in such contributions to Licensor and waives all moral rights therein. Licensee agrees to execute any documents necessary to perfect such assignment. Licensor may incorporate such contributions at its sole discretion without any obligation to Licensee.

## 8. Intellectual Property Rights

This Agreement grants no intellectual property rights except as explicitly stated herein. Licensor retains all rights, title and interest in and to all intellectual property rights, including but not limited to patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, and any other proprietary rights related to the Source Code. Any commercial use requires a separate written license agreement from Licensor specifically granting such intellectual property rights.

## 9. Remedies

Licensee acknowledges that breach of this Agreement will cause irreparable harm to Licensor for which monetary damages would be inadequate, entitling Licensor to immediate injunctive relief, specific performance, and any other remedies available at law or equity, without posting a bond or proving actual damages. Licensee shall be liable for Licensor's reasonable attorneys' fees and costs in enforcing this Agreement. In addition, the parties agree that in the event of a breach, Licensee shall pay Licensor liquidated damages of $50,000 per breach or unauthorized disclosure, whichever is greater, which the parties acknowledge as a reasonable estimate of the harm incurred by Licensor.

## 10. Warranty Disclaimer

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, ACCURACY, OR SYSTEM INTEGRATION. LICENSOR MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET LICENSEE'S REQUIREMENTS OR OPERATE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF THE SOURCE CODE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

## 12. Termination

This Agreement terminates automatically and immediately upon Licensee's breach of any provision. Upon termination or expiration, Licensee must (a) immediately cease all use of the Source Code, (b) permanently destroy all copies, notes, and analyses derived from the Source Code, (c) certify such destruction in writing to Licensor within 3 business days, and (d) allow Licensor to audit Licensee's systems, facilities, and records to confirm compliance, at Licensee's expense. Sections 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

## 13. Governing Law

The parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal and state courts located in New Castle County, Delaware for all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.

### International Arbitration

In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including the breach, termination, or validity thereof, the parties shall first seek to resolve the matter amicably through mutual discussions. If such resolution is not achieved within thirty (30) days, the dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). The place of arbitration shall be New Castle County, Delaware, and the proceedings shall be conducted in English. The arbitral award shall be final and binding on the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

### Injunctive Relief and Liquidated Damages

Licensee acknowledges that any breach of this Agreement by Licensee will result in irreparable harm to Licensor, for which monetary damages alone would be insufficient. Therefore, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, Licensor shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief and specific performance, without the necessity of posting a bond or other security. Furthermore, Licensee agrees to pay Licensor liquidated damages in the amount of $50,000 for each instance of unauthorized use, disclosure, or distribution of the Source Code or any Derivative Work, as a reasonable estimate of the harm caused, which is difficult to quantify.
